Install and Configure a Multi-Master HA Kubernetes Cluster with kubeadm, HAProxy and Keepalived on CentOS 7

Pre-requisites
For Kubernetes, we will use 3 control-plane nodes and 3 worker nodes. We will also use 2 servers for HAProxy to provide high availability with a virtual IP addess of 10.11.1.30.

We will need a DNS server. My DNS server configuration is described here and wonâ€™t be covered in this article. One small change is that I stopped using hl.local and moved to a reserved top level DNS name hl.test (see rfc2606 for more info).

Below are our requirements for the installation:

2 servers for HAProxy with Keepalived, running CentOS 7, 1 CPU, 1 GB RAM, 8 GB disk.
3 servers for control-plane nodes, running CentOS 7, 2 CPU, 4 GB RAM, 16 GB disk.
3 servers for worker nodes, running CentOS 7, 2 CPU, 6 GB RAM, 16 GB disk.
Full network connectivity between all machines in the cluster.
sudo privileges on all machines.
SSH access from one device to all nodes in the system.
A DNS server with a DNS entry for the HAProxy load balancer pointing to a virtual IP address 10.11.1.30.

Homelab details can be seen in the table below.
